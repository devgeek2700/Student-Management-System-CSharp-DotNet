Thanks! Based on your **Solution Explorer screenshot**, here is an **updated and detailed `README.md`** in **Markdown format**. It now includes:

* Clear explanation of project architecture
* Code structure from your solution
* Purpose of folders like `Controllers`, `DB_CONNECT`, `Models`, `Enums`, `Views`
* A breakdown of how data flows (MVC pattern)

# 🎓 Student Management System (C#/.NET MVC)

A **modular, full-featured Student Management System** built with **C#** and **.NET MVC**, designed to efficiently manage Students, Teachers, Courses, and Departments. The system uses a layered architecture with a strong separation of concerns via Controllers, Repositories, and ViewModels.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Full **CRUD operations** for:
  - Students 👨‍🎓
  - Teachers 👩‍🏫
  - Courses 📘
  - Departments 🏢
- 🔁 Many-to-Many relationships (StudentCourse & TeacherCourse)
- 🔎 Search, filter, and view reports by department, course, etc.
- 🏷️ Gender enum support
- 🧩 Repository and Interface-driven DB layer for easy maintenance

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

Follows a clean MVC architecture:

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔁 Data Flow

1. **Controller** → Handles user interaction  
2. **Repository** (via interface) → Interacts with database  
3. **Models / ViewModels** → Transport data to/from Views  
4. **Views** → Render data on UI using Razor (.cshtml)

---

## 🔁 CRUD Features

### 👨‍🎓 Students

- **Add/Edit Student** with name, gender, department, courses
- Assign multiple courses (via `StudentCourse`)
- Delete or update info from list view

### 👩‍🏫 Teachers

- Manage teacher info and assigned courses
- Each teacher is linked to a department
- Many-to-many relation using `TeacherCourse`

### 📚 Courses & Departments

- Create, edit, and delete courses
- Assign courses to students and teachers
- Departments categorize both students and teachers
